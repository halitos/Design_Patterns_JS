# Chain of Responsibility

Chain of Responsibility is a behavioural pattern that provides a chain of loosely coupled objects one of which can satisfy a request. 

An example of a chain of responsibility is event bubbling in which events propagate through a series of nested controls, one of which may choose to handle the event. 

This pattern is can be found within Event Handling in the DOM.
