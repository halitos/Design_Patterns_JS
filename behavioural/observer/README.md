# Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern is a behavioural design pattern that lets you define a subscriptuon mechanism to notify multiple objects (observers) about any events that happen to the object they're observing. This pattern is also called Pub/Sub short for Publication/Subscription.

The Observer pattern is the foundation of event-driven programming. We write handler functions that will be notified when a certain event fires.
