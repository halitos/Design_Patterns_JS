# Abstract Factory

An Abstract Factory creates objects that are related by a common theme. In object-oriented programming a Factory is an object that creates other objects. An Abstract Factory has abstracted out a theme which is shared by the newly created objects.

JavaScript doesn't have the concept of abstract classes however it can be achieved by ensuring all factory methods use the same signature.
