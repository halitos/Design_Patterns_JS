# Adapter Pattern

The adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects or classes with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It matches interfaces of different classes or objects; therefore, they can work together despite incompatible interfaces. It is also referred to as the Wrapper pattern.

An example might be writing an adapter to allow us to call a new version of an API but changing the response to match that of the old API
