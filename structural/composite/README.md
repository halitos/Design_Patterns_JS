# Composite Pattern

The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects. 

An example of this pattern would be tree control. The nodes of the tree can either contain an individual object or a group of objects. 

Modern frameworks such as React and Vue use the composite pattern to build interfaces.
