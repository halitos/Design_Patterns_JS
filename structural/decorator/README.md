The decorator pattern is a structural pattern that aims to promote reuse. This pattern allows behaviour to be added to an object dynamically without affecting the behaviour of other objects from the same class. 

JavaScript allows adds methods and properties to be added to objects dynamically so this is a simple pattern to implement.
